- Templates only extend out to 23969 Angstroms.  Would need to cut off
  fit at 2.394 microns or something like that.

- Many templates seem to have emission at 2.37 microns.  Looks like
  this may be where orders are glued together -- the 'emission' is
  very rounded.  gaboo_out.fits is a good template without much of
  this problem.  Looking at the actual data, this is indeed what is
  happening -- in most of the templates there are little holes, the
  biggest of which is at 2.37 microns.  This combined with my spline
  interpolation in generating the templates seems to be causing
  issues.  Even gaboo has a 5 Angstrom break, while others have 10
  angstrom breaks (compared to 0.1 Angstrom pixels).

- These breaks clearly will cause problems with fits but below 2.37
  microns, they are <4 angstroms which is only two pixels in my final
  spectrum.  Probably not so bad.  Could potentially propogate this
  through.
