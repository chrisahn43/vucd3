        We present an atlas of high-resolution (R >= 45,000) 2.02-2.41 um
     spectra of 12 representative stars, a sunspot, three Mira variables,
     and a carbon star.  The star sample, MK spectral types from about
     early-G to about mid-M, with luminosity classes drwarf to supergiant.
     The Mira variables are one each of M, S, and C types.  All of the
     spectra have been corrected for atmospheric absorption and have the
     major spectral features labeled with responsible absorbers.  Spectra
     and line lists are also available on the AAS CD-ROM series Vol. 7. The
     2.0-2.4 um region includes molecular vibration-rotation transitions
     from the CO first overtone, HF fundamental, and several bands of H2O
     as well as the CN red system, an electronic transition.  The relative
     contribution of H2O versus CN in cool star spectra is discussed.
     Atomic features include clean measurable lines of H, C, Na, Mg, Al,
     Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, and Fe.  We discuss temperature and luminosity
     spectral indicators and the effects of blending on these indicators at
     lower spectral resolution.
