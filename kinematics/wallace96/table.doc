Abstract:
     We present an atlas of high-resolution (R >= 45,000) 2.02-2.41 um
  spectra of 12 representative stars, a sunspot, three Mira variables,
  and a carbon star.  The star sample, MK spectral types from about
  early-G to about mid-M, with luminosity classes drwarf to supergiant.
  The Mira variables are one each of M, S, and C types.  All of the
  spectra have been corrected for atmospheric absorption and have the
  major spectral features labeled with responsible absorbers.  Spectra
  and line lists are also available on the AAS CD-ROM series Vol. 7. The
  2.0-2.4 um region includes molecular vibration-rotation transitions
  from the CO first overtone, HF fundamental, and several bands of H2O
  as well as the CN red system, an electronic transition.  The relative
  contribution of H2O versus CN in cool star spectra is discussed.
  Atomic features include clean measurable lines of H, C, Na, Mg, Al,
  Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, and Fe.  We discuss temperature and luminosity
  spectral indicators and the effects of blending on these indicators at
  lower spectral resolution.
